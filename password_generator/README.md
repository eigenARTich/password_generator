# PASSWORD GENERATOR

## Introduction

This is a simple password generator implemented in Python, designed for beginners who want to create random and secure passwords. The program allows users to customize the password's minimum length and choose whether to include numbers and special characters.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script using your preferred Python interpreter.
2. The program will prompt you to enter the minimum length for the password.
3. Next, you will be asked whether you want to include numbers (digits) in the password. Enter 'y' for yes or 'n' for no.
4. Similarly, you will be asked whether you want to include special characters in the password. Again, enter 'y' for yes or 'n' for no.
5. The program will generate a random password based on your preferences and display it on the screen.

## Password Criteria

- The generated password will have a minimum length as specified by the user.
- If the user chooses to include numbers, the password will contain at least one digit.
- If the user chooses to include special characters, the password will contain at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, $, %, etc.).
- The rest of the password will be composed of random uppercase and lowercase letters.

## Dependencies

The code uses the `string` and `secrets` modules, which are built-in Python libraries and do not require any additional installation.

## Security Considerations

While this password generator aims to create relatively strong passwords for beginners, it may not adhere to all best practices of password generation. For increased security, it is recommended to use password managers, enable two-factor authentication, and avoid using the same password across multiple accounts.

## Acknowledgments

This password generator is a basic implementation to help beginners get started with generating random passwords. Feel free to modify and enhance it based on your needs and understanding of password security. Always prioritize strong and unique passwords for your online accounts. Stay safe and secure!
